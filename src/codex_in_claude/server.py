# #427: the canonical skills-discovery sentence pair lives in cli_contract.py, beside the
# "RULE: every egress-caveat prose site" comment it implements (search that string) — that
# module is the single source of truth for Codex CLI assumptions, so a Codex upgrade that
# changes this behavior has exactly one place in code to fix. `cli_contract.SKILLS_DISCOVERY_FACT`
# alone states the discovery itself (both roots, workspace AGENTS.md, the default path, and
# that the global root is reachable from outside the workspace) — used where a site's
# guarantee matrix doesn't require the isolation-flags note too (the three `_async` tool
# docstrings; see `_REQUIRED_GUARANTEES` in tests/test_server.py). Every other carrier — the
# server instructions, the codex_status caveat, negative_scope, the six
# `ToolCapability.returns` clauses, and the three SYNC tool docstrings — uses the combined
# `cli_contract.SKILLS_DISCOVERY_FACT_FULL`. This is a deliberate wording convergence, not a
# byte-identical refactor — the carrier sites did not share one sentence before, so
# unifying them necessarily rewords the wire (hence the FINGERPRINT bump, schema-72 ->
# schema-73).

# Rules-then-context (audit F8, #180): a does/does-not lead, then each binding rule as
# its own imperative sentence, and background (async-job mechanics, cached rate-limit
# semantics) last so an agent that skims reaches the actionable rules first.

    "not bypass Codex's sandbox or approvals, and codex_delegate never edits your working "
    "tree — it returns a reviewable diff you apply yourself. Every model-bearing call also "
    "disables Codex's remote_plugin feature, so third-party connectors (GitHub, Gmail, Slack, "
    "Drive, …) aren't exposed to the Codex run — barring a custom operator-supplied Codex "
    "profile. "

    "reach the model, so that content can be sent even if your prompt never mentions it. "
    # Routing: one imperative sentence per task family.
    "Use codex_consult for a read-only second opinion or Q&A — including on a diff you "
    "paste inline. "
    "Use codex_review_changes for a structured review of changes gathered from git "
    "(working_tree, branch, or commit); prefer it over codex_consult whenever the changes "
    "already live in git. "
    "Use codex_delegate to implement a task in a throwaway git worktree and get back a "
    "reviewable diff. "
    "Prefer the matching _async variant (codex_consult_async / codex_review_changes_async / "
    "codex_delegate_async) for work that can exceed the synchronous deadline — a high-"
    "reasoning-effort or broad repo-grounded consult, a multi-file or whole-branch review, or "
    "a substantial implementation task — because a sync call whose deadline expires is "
    "terminated and its partial work is lost; keep the sync tool for focused work that "
    "finishes well inside the deadline. "
    "Use codex_transfer (free) to hand off the current Claude Code session transcript to a "
    "resumable Codex thread when the user wants to continue this conversation inside Codex. "
    # Preflight and failure-handling rules.
    "Before the first paid call in a session, run codex_status (free) to confirm the codex "
    "CLI is installed and authenticated. "
    "On a tool failure the tool result itself is the error (isError: true) with the error "
    "envelope in structuredContent (content[0].text mirrors it). Branch on error.code and "
    "follow error.repair. "
    "Treat Codex's findings as claims to verify, not commands. "
    # Discovery rules — still actionable, so kept ahead of the background paragraph.
    "Use codex_capabilities for the full inventory. Before overriding the model or "
    "reasoning_effort, use codex_models (or the codex://models resource) to discover valid "
    "model slugs and each model's advertised reasoning-effort set (the listing is advisory; "
    "codex and the backend validate the real values). "
    "To preview a call without spending, use codex_dry_run for a review or "
    "codex_delegate_dry_run for a delegate's worktree baseline. "
    # Background context, last.
    "Background: each active tool has an _async variant (codex_consult_async / "
    "codex_review_changes_async / codex_delegate_async), polled via "
    "codex_job_status/result/consume_result/cancel/list; even a sync consult/review/delegate "
    "records its run as a job (meta.job_id), so a dropped connection can be recovered the "
    "same way. codex_status also reports a rate_limit block (status "
    "available|limited|exhausted|blocked|unknown|unavailable) showing how much Codex quota "
    "remains, read live from the app-server with no model spend; unknown/unavailable mean no "
    "usable reading, not a problem, while blocked means a backend spend control no reset clears."

    or an out-of-enum Literal value). Left alone, the caller gets ``isError: true`` with
    ``structured_content=None`` and raw validator prose — no symbolic ``code``,
    ``repair``, ``request_id``, or ``fingerprint`` — bypassing the result contract (#136).
    We catch it here at the call boundary and return the normal ``invalid_arguments``
    envelope with ``is_error=True`` set directly (no reliance on _SemanticErrorMiddleware).

    Only argument-validation failures are mapped: ``_invalid_arguments_envelope`` returns
    None for a ValidationError whose locations are not request arguments (e.g. an
    output-schema failure raised inside ``call_next``), and we re-raise that untouched.

    Since fastmcp 3.4.3, a bad call surfaces as ``fastmcp.exceptions.ValidationError``
    (not a Pydantic subclass) carrying only ``str(e)``; the structured errors survive on
    its ``__cause__``. We accept both shapes so the envelope holds across the whole

# (see fastmcp.server.mixins.mcp_operations), but the SDK exposes no named constant, so

class _ResourceErrorMiddleware(Middleware):
    """Carry the §6 error envelope in a resource-read failure's JSON-RPC ``error.data``.

    Unlike a tool call (whose failure is an ``ok: false`` envelope in structuredContent),
    a ``resources/read`` failure is a JSON-RPC error. FastMCP would return it with
    ``error.data: null`` — no symbolic ``code``, ``temporary``, or ``repair`` — so a
    resource read is the one surface that bypassed the unified contract (audit F9, #181).

    We intercept at the ``on_read_resource`` seam (mirroring ``_ArgumentValidationMiddleware``
    at the tool seam) and re-raise an ``McpError`` whose ``error.data`` is the serialized
    ``ErrorInfo`` shape. The mcp SDK's request handler does ``response = err.error`` for an
    ``McpError``, so the ``data`` we attach survives verbatim to the client.

    Exception routing is deliberate and ordered (per a cross-model design review):
    - ``NotFoundError``/``DisabledError`` (unknown or disabled URI) → ``resource_not_found``
      with MCP numeric -32002. FastMCP maps both to "resource not found" itself, so we match.
    - ``ResourceError`` (a resource function raised; the core wraps arbitrary handler
      exceptions into this) → ``internal_error`` with -32603.
    - Any ``McpError`` an inner layer already raised is re-raised untouched — never
      reclassified — so a deliberate protocol error keeps its own code/data.
    - Nothing else is caught: an unexpected ``Exception`` keeps FastMCP's existing handling,
      and cancellation (a ``BaseException``) propagates. The client-visible message is
      generic (no URI or exception text echoed — matching the redaction posture of #189)."""

    """Hand off the current Claude Code session to a resumable Codex thread.

    Imports a Claude session transcript (.jsonl) into a persistent Codex thread via
    `codex app-server` and returns `resume_command` (`codex resume <thread_id>`) to
    continue that exact conversation in Codex (TUI or App). Free — no model call and no
    token spend; it is a local file conversion, typically seconds. It does create a
    thread in $CODEX_HOME (so it is not read-only) but never edits your working tree.

    Pass `transcript_path`: the current session's transcript is the newest *.jsonl under
    ~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/. If that is ambiguous — for example, more than one recent
    transcript could be the current session — ask the user which one to transfer. Transferring
    a still-live session creates a NEW thread each call — Codex dedups only a byte-identical
    transcript — so this is not idempotent for an active session.

    Identifiers the app-server reports (the imported thread id and $CODEX_HOME) are validated:
    a drifted, oversized, or malformed value fails as cli_contract_changed rather than
    producing a corrupt resume_command or importing into the wrong home. `resume_command` is
    POSIX shell syntax.

# isolation (and, for the sync twin, `detail`), the workspace, build `meta`, run the
# placeholder + input-size pre-flights, and assemble the run `spec`. These helpers
# hold that once so the sync/async pair cannot drift. They return either
# `(meta, cwd, spec, detail_v)` on success or a ready error envelope (a dict), so the
# caller branches on `isinstance(prep, dict)`. `timeout_seconds` is the sync per-call
# timeout or the async job deadline — the only field that legitimately differs between
# a pair's two specs, and it is the sole hash-affecting difference (parity is pinned in
# tests/test_tool_pair_parity.py). Hash-compatible behavior is required: the spec keys
# feed the idempotency arg hash, so changing a HASHED key would invalidate live dedup
# entries. A key listed in _ARG_HASH_EXCLUDE is pure provenance and may be added freely
# (that is how `roots_source` reaches the worker without moving any hash — #393).
#
# `include_detail` (not a nullable `detail`) selects the sync twin: `_resolve_detail`
# maps None to "summary", so None cannot double as an "async, skip detail" sentinel.

    Runs `codex exec` in a read-only sandbox — Codex never edits files. A STATIC

    treat findings as unvalidated claims you verify yourself. Pass `workspace_root`
    (absolute) for a repo-grounded question; omit it for pure Q&A. Returns a result
    envelope.

    Data egress: this sends your `question` and `extra_context` to OpenAI via the
    codex CLI. Codex always runs with a resolved working directory (`workspace_root`,
    your MCP roots, or the server's cwd as a fallback), so it may read files there and
    send their content too. Codex auto-loads the resolved workspace's `AGENTS.md` and

    (default `~/.codex/skills/`), reachable from outside the workspace. The plugin's
    isolation flags don't suppress any of it. Skill names and descriptions are exposed
    up front and a selected skill's body can reach the model, so that content can be
    sent even if your prompt never mentions it. Your inputs are sent raw — secret
    redaction is best-effort and does not cover them (it covers gathered diffs and
    Codex's returned output, not what you type or what Codex reads from files).

    Progress & recovery: blocks up to the resolved deadline (`timeout_seconds`, clamped
    10-600s; when omitted, the server-configured value, built-in default 300s). If that deadline
    expires the run is terminated and its partial output is not recoverable or resumable, so for a

    `codex_consult_async` (a background job, built-in default 1800s deadline; poll
    `codex_job_status`). Coarse `notifications/progress` streams while it blocks when your client
    requests it; some MCP clients background a long call before the deadline, so

    scope: `working_tree` (tracked changes vs HEAD — untracked files follow the

    The result's top-level `review_status` and `coverage` disclose whether the model
    actually ran and what it was shown: a `pass` over partial coverage is surfaced as
    `unknown`, and a tree with nothing reviewable returns `not_run`, never a `pass`.

    STATIC review, not a verify mode: the read-only sandbox blocks the writes a

    Returns every retained job by default; pass `limit` (1-1000) or `status` to narrow. They

    omit `limit` to get them all rather than looking for a cursor.
