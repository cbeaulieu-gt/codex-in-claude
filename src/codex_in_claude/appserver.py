"""Minimal one-shot `codex app-server` client for session transfer.

Codex-specific (NOT under ``_core``): it encodes the experimental
``externalAgentConfig/import`` protocol used by ``codex_transfer`` to hand a Claude
Code session transcript to a resumable Codex thread. It spawns ``codex app-server``,
performs the ``initialize``/``initialized`` handshake, sends exactly ONE import
request, waits for the matching ``.../import/completed`` notification, then
terminates the child. Deliberately single-request — no broker, no session reuse
(upstream's long-lived broker is the source of most of its transfer bug reports).

Every wire assumption (method/notification names, field names, the ledger filename,
the ``-32601`` sentinel) lives in :mod:`codex_in_claude.cli_contract`. This module
maps the run to a plain :class:`TransferOutcome`; the server layer turns that into the
result envelope. It may import from ``_core`` (one-way dependency) but nothing in
``_core`` imports it.

    bounds one JSONL *line* at 8 MiB; without this there is no cap between that line and
    the agent's context window, and no redaction between it and an MCP error envelope.

    Redaction runs BEFORE truncation: cutting first can split a secret so no pattern
    matches, publishing its prefix. The result never exceeds ``_MAX_DISPLAY_CHARS`` — an
    over-cap value ends in ``_DISPLAY_TRUNC_MARKER`` so a reader can tell a clipped
    diagnostic from a complete one. Non-strings are coerced (``None`` -> ``""``), since
    every field here is ``.get()``-ed off untrusted JSON and may be any type.

    Apply this to the foreign *fragment* only — never to a composed message — so a long
    fragment can never truncate away our own static explanation. Any future app-server
    string that reaches an envelope (e.g. ``stderr_tail``, #275) must route through here.

    Callers decide *whether a diagnostic exists* by testing the RAW wire value, not this
    function's output. Every falsey JSON value (``null``, ``""``, ``0``, ``false``, ``[]``,
    ``{}``) carries no diagnostic text, but coercing one here yields a truthy string, so
    branching on the sanitized result would emit noise like ``rejected the import: {}``
    instead of a clean generic sentence. The converse cannot happen: a truthy ``detail``
    never sanitizes to ``""`` (``redact_text`` substitutes a non-empty placeholder), so no
    caller can strand a prefix with an empty fragment after it.

    Every post-spawn exit in ``transfer_session`` and ``read_rate_limits`` funnels through
    here before building its outcome (#449 root cause): Python evaluates a ``return``

    below is load-bearing, never rearrange it: settle only AFTER the producer is stopped,
    because a quiesce that joins the drain while the child can still hold stderr open would
    either block for its whole bound or still miss stderr written after the join gives up.

    1. Release a reader parked in ``put()`` on a full queue — same as the original
       ``finally``, done first so a stopped consumer doesn't strand that thread.
    2. Terminate the child. ``_terminate`` is meant to be invoked exactly ONCE per child —
       the suppressed exceptions inside it (``ProcessLookupError``, ``PermissionError``,
       ``OSError``) cover races within that single invocation (e.g. the process already
       gone by the time the signal is sent), not tolerance for a repeat call. A second
       invocation AFTER this one has already reaped the leader is not safe: the OS is free
       to recycle that pid for an unrelated process before the repeat runs, and
       ``_terminate``'s suppression would then swallow nothing — it would signal a process
       it was never meant to touch. This is exactly why the caller (see the ``settled``
       pattern in ``transfer_session`` / ``read_rate_limits``) skips its own ``finally``
       call once this function has already run one (#449 external review finding 1).
    3. Join the stdout reader thread, bounded by ``_POLL_SECONDS``.
    4. Quiesce the stderr drain, bounded by the larger ``_QUIESCE_SECONDS``: the child is
       dead by this point, so its pipe closes and the drain reaches EOF almost immediately
