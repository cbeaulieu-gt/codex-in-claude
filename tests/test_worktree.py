# --- WSL gitdir-pointer fail-fast guard (fork issue #4, plan §3.6) -----------------
#
# Resolved posture: `codex_delegate`'s write path (`git worktree add`) must REFUSE,
# not translate, when it detects a Windows-shaped `gitdir:` pointer -- a translated
# GIT_DIR would make `git worktree add` write a WSL-shaped path into the user's own
# `.git/worktrees/*/gitdir`, a cross-tool pollution of their real repository
# (unreadable from Windows-side git). So, unlike `gitdiff.py`, `worktree._base_env`
# must NEVER apply `wslpath.git_dir_override` -- the guard raises instead, at the
# point `_ensure_repo_with_head` runs (worktree.py:290-296 today), before any write.

    # The fix must raise a message that actually names the condition. Matched on a
